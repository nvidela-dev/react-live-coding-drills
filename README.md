# React Live Coding Drills

A collection of 5 React interview live coding exercises. Each exercise is a standalone React project with:

- A **README.md** describing the requirements
- **Unit tests** that validate your implementation
- A **starter template** to begin coding

## Exercises

| # | Exercise | Concepts Tested |
|---|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | [Todo List](./01-todo-list) | useState, event handling, list rendering, CRUD |
| 2 | [Counter with Hooks](./02-counter-hooks) | useState, useEffect, cleanup functions |
| 3 | [Data Fetching](./03-data-fetching) | useEffect, async/await, loading states, error handling |
| 4 | [Form Validation](./04-form-validation) | controlled components, validation logic, form submission |
| 5 | [Search & Filter](./05-search-filter) | filtering arrays, debouncing, performance optimization |

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to an exercise folder:
   ```bash
   cd 01-todo-list
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Read the README.md for requirements

4. Run tests to see what needs to be implemented:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Implement the solution until all tests pass

## Rules for Live Coding

- Read the requirements carefully before starting
- Run tests frequently to check your progress
- Focus on making tests pass, not on perfect styling
- Time yourself to simulate interview conditions (30-45 min per exercise)
